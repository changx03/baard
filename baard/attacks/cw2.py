    This attack was originally proposed by Carlini and Wagner. It is an
    iterative attack that finds adversarial examples on many defenses that
    are robust to other attacks.
    Paper link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04644
    At a high level, this attack is an iterative attack using Adam and
    a specially-chosen loss function to find adversarial examples with
    lower distortion than other attacks. This comes at the cost of speed,
    as this attack is often much slower than others.
    :param model_fn: a callable that takes an input tensor and returns
              the model logits. The logits should be a tensor of shape
              (n_examples, n_classes).
    :param x: input tensor of shape (n_examples, ...), where ... can
              be any arbitrary dimension that is compatible with
              model_fn.
    :param n_classes: the number of classes.
    :param y: (optional) Tensor with true labels. If targeted is true,
              then provide the target label. Otherwise, only provide
              this parameter if you'd like to use true labels when
              crafting adversarial samples. Otherwise, model predictions
              are used as labels to avoid the "label leaking" effect
              (explained in this paper:
              https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01236). If provide y, it
              should be a 1D tensor of shape (n_examples, ).
              Default is None.
    :param targeted: (optional) bool. Is the attack targeted or
              untargeted? Untargeted, the default, will try to make the
              label incorrect. Targeted will instead try to move in the
              direction of being more like y.
    :param lr: (optional) float. The learning rate for the attack
              algorithm. Default is 5e-3.
    :param confidence: (optional) float. Confidence of adversarial
              examples: higher produces examples with larger l2
              distortion, but more strongly classified as adversarial.
              Default is 0.
    :param clip_min: (optional) float. Minimum float value for
              adversarial example components. Default is 0.
    :param clip_max: (optional) float. Maximum float value for
              adversarial example components. Default is 1.
    :param initial_const: The initial tradeoff-constant to use to tune the
              relative importance of size of the perturbation and
              confidence of classification. If binary_search_steps is
              large, the initial constant is not important. A smaller
              value of this constant gives lower distortion results.
              Default is 1e-2.
    :param binary_search_steps: (optional) int. The number of times we
              perform binary search to find the optimal tradeoff-constant
              between norm of the perturbation and confidence of the
              classification. Default is 5.
    :param max_iterations: (optional) int. The maximum number of
              iterations. Setting this to a larger value will produce
              lower distortion results. Using only a few iterations
              requires a larger learning rate, and will produce larger
              distortion results. Default is 1000.

                class (int).
